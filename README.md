# VideoSnap

VideoSnap is an OSX command line tool for recording video and audio from any
attached QuickTime capture device.

See the argument list below for all available options. By default videosnap will
capture and encode using the H.264(SD480)/AAC format to 'movie.mov'. If you do
not specify a duration, capturing will continue until you interrupt with CTRL+c.

You can also use VideoSnap to list attached QuickTime capture devices by name.

This command was inspired by [ImageSnap](https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap)
from [@rharder](https://github.com/rharder), and driven by problems with the
older (carbon based) [wacaw](http://webcam-tools.sourceforge.net) command
(which no longer works with some of the latest Mac/OSX hardware).

## Usage

The following options are available:

```
  -l    List attached QuickTime capture devices
  -t    Set duration of video (in seconds)
  -w    Set delay before capturing starts (in seconds)
  -d    Set the capture device by name (use -l to list attached devices)
  -s    Set the H.264 video size/quality (use 120, 240, SD480 (default) HD720)
  -v    Turn ON verbose mode (OFF by default)
  -h    Show help
  --no-audio
        Don't capture audio (audio IS captured by default)
```

### Examples

It's hard to show a screencast of VideoSnap in action so I've recorded an
[ascii.io](http://ascii.io/a/5358) video instead! Or follow along with the
examples below;

Capture 10.75 secs of video in 720HD format to movie.mov

    videosnap -t 10.75 -s 'HD720'

Capture 1 minute of SD480 video (default), but no audio from the
"Built-in iSight" device, delaying for 5 secs, saving to my_video.mov

    videosnap -t 60 -w 5 -d 'Built-in iSight' --no-audio my_video.mov

## Warming Up

Since some QT cameras can take a while to _warm up_ a default delay of
0.5 secs has been chosen. You can override this by setting the `-w`
argument with any number of seconds (0 would be no delay).

## Compatibility

VideoSnap is OSX only, and should work without any issues on OSX 10.5+.
If you do run into problems with the command, please [report an
issue](https://github.com/matthutchinson/videosnap/issues).

## Contibuting

If you would like to suggest a feature or report a bug, please use [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/matthutchinson/videosnap/issues) and if possible
(fork the project) and submit a pull-request. When reporting a bug, please
clearly indicate what platform and hardware you are running and the steps I
should take to reproduce the issue.

## Development

VideoSnap is coded with Objective-C and uses the
[Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html) and
[QTKit](https://developer.apple.com/quicktime/) frameworks to capture video.
You can build the project with [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
(using the Xcode project in the repository, or via the command line with
`xcodebuild`)

## License

License](https://github.com/matthutchinson/videosnap/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
(MIT).

## Ideas

* Submit VideoSnap as a package for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
* Default filename should include a time stamp of when recording began
* Allow more size/quality options for video and/or audio
* Allow VideoSnap to capture a single frame to an image file (with compression
  options based on file type like [ImageSnap](https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap))
* Add optional window pane showing a CaptureView during recording
* Add a comprehensive test suite in Xcode
* Allow VideoSnap to pipe output video
