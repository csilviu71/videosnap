{"name":"Videosnap","tagline":"Simple command line app to record video and audio from a QuickTime capture device","body":"# VideoSnap\r\n\r\nVideoSnap is an OSX command line tool for recording video and audio from any\r\nattached QuickTime capture device.\r\n\r\nYou can specify which device to capture from, the duration, size/quality, a\r\ndelay period (before capturing starts) and optionally turn off audio capturing.\r\n\r\nThe only _required_ argument is a file path. By default VideoSnap will capture 6\r\nseconds of video and audio from the default capture device in H.264(SD480)/AAC\r\nencoding to 'movie.mov'. You can also use VideoSnap to list attached QuickTime\r\ncapture devices by name.\r\n\r\nThis command was inspired by [ImageSnap](https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap)\r\nfrom [@rharder](https://github.com/rharder), and driven by problems with the\r\nolder (carbon based) [wacaw](http://webcam-tools.sourceforge.net) command\r\n(which no longer works with some of the latest Mac/OSX hardware).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe following options are available:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -l    List attached QuickTime capture devices\r\n  -t    Set duration of video (in seconds, default 6s)\r\n  -w    Set delay before capturing starts (in seconds, default 0s)\r\n  -d    Set the capture device by name (use -l to list attached devices)\r\n  -s    Set the H.264 video size/quality (use 120, 240, SD480 (default) HD720)\r\n  -v    Turn ON verbose mode (OFF by default)\r\n  -h    Show help\r\n  --no-audio\r\n        Don't capture audio (audio IS captured by default)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nCapture 10.75 secs of video in 720HD format to movie.mov\r\n\r\n    videosnap -t 10.75 -s 'HD720'\r\n\r\nCapture 1 minute of SD480 video (default), but no audio from the\r\n\"Built-in iSight\" device, delaying for 5 secs, saving to my_video.mov\r\n\r\n    videosnap -t 60 -w 5 -d 'Built-in iSight' --no-audio my_video.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nVideoSnap is OSX only, and should work without any issues on OSX 10.5+.\r\nIf you do run into problems with the command, please [report an\r\nissue](https://github.com/matthutchinson/videosnap/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contibuting\r\n\r\nIf you would like to suggest a feature or report a bug, please use [GitHub\r\nissues](https://github.com/matthutchinson/videosnap/issues) and if possible\r\n(fork the project) and submit a pull-request. When reporting a bug, please\r\nclearly indicate what platform and hardware you are running and the steps I\r\nshould take to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nVideoSnap is coded with Objective-C and uses the\r\n[Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html) and\r\n[QTKit](https://developer.apple.com/quicktime/) frameworks to capture video.\r\nYou can build the project with [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\r\n(using the Xcode project in the repository, or via the command line with\r\n`xcodebuild`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\n* Default filename should include a time stamp of when recording began\r\n* Allow more size/quality options for video and/or audio\r\n* Allow VideoSnap to capture a single frame to an image file (with compression\r\n  options based on file type like [ImageSnap](https://github.com/rharder/imagesnap))\r\n* Add optional window pane showing a CaptureView during recording\r\n* Add a comprehensive test suite in Xcode\r\n* Add a pkg installer\r\n","google":"UA-2334875-16","note":"Don't delete this file!
